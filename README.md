# 🧠 NEURO-NANO

**Neuro-Nano** is a lightweight local AI inference setup using a quantized GGUF model, designed for fast execution, offline usage, and low-resource systems.

This repository contains the **inference code and runtime tools**.
The **model weights are hosted separately** on Hugging Face.

🚀 Features
---
⚡ Fast local inference using optimized GGUF models  
🧠 Supports quantized LLMs for efficient on-device AI  
💻 Fully offline — no internet or API dependency  
🪶 Runs on low-RAM systems (consumer-grade hardware)  
🧩 Modular design for easy model swapping and extension  
🔒 Privacy-friendly (all inference runs locally)  
⚙️ Cross-platform execution (Windows/Linux)  
📦 Lightweight deployment without cloud setup  


## 📦 Model Weights

Due to GitHub file size limits, the model is hosted on Hugging Face.
